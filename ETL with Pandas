I was working on a CRM deployment and needed to migrate data from the old system to the new one. (EXCEL csv.)

import pandas as pd

# setting file names
FILE_MASTERS = 'masters.csv'
FILE_LOOKUP = 'lookup.csv'
FILE_MASTERS_DUPS = 'masters_dups.csv'
FILE_OUT = 'output.csv'


# reading data from masters file
df_masters = pd.read_csv(FILE_MASTERS)


# sorting records by IDs 
# note 100002 and 100006 are duplicates
df_masters.sort_values('ID', ascending=True, inplace=True)


# output duplicates to a file for further analysis
df_dups = df_masters[df_masters.duplicated(keep='first')]
df_dups.to_csv(FILE_MASTERS_DUPS)


# remove duplicates by IDs except for the first occurence
df_masters.drop_duplicates(subset='ID', keep='first', inplace=True)


# reading data from lookup file
# Country info is stored in this file
df_lookup = pd.read_csv(FILE_LOOKUP)


# df_masters is on left, df_lookup is on right
# merging (joining) tables by IDs
# using a left join purposefully to show records without Country info
df_join_left = pd.merge(df_masters, df_lookup, how="left", on=['ID'])


# illustrating how to remove column(s)
df_join_left.drop(['Name'], axis=1, inplace=True)


# output merged data to file
df_join_left.to_csv(FILE_OUT)
